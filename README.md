# Course_schedule_flutter_app
This is a Course Schedule app. This app maintains the schedule of upcoming lectures and past classes on weekdays. Adding and removing the course schedule is extremely simple, making it convenient for the students to use this app. Still, I am working on this app to make it more useful and efficient for the student community based on the feedback received from students.

The app consists of Home Screen Consisting of two Tabs 1st one is Upcoming Lecture Schedule along with its venue, and another tab listing all the past Lectures that are supposed to be attended by the student in the past. Student just just have to open the app and at the topmost he/she will find all the details of his/her next lecture. This apps avoids students getting meshed up with the lecture schedules and lecture venue and helps the students to increase their productivity and attend their lectures on time.

Here are the some screenshots of the app.
